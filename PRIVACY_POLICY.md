# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 2, 2026

**AhKyaway Mhat** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our mobile application.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage

**AhKyaway Mhat** is primarily an offline-first application. We do not host any central servers to store your personal financial data.

*   **Local Storage**: All data (customers, debts, payments) is stored locally on your device.
*   **Encryption**: We use industry-standard encryption (AES) to ensure your data remains secure on your device.

## 2. Google Drive Data Backup (Cloud Service)

We offer an optional **Cloud Backup & Restore** feature that allows you to safeguard your data. This feature utilizes Google Drive API services.

### How we use your Google User Data:

*   **Access**: We ask for permission to access your Google Drive App Data folder (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata`).
*   **Use**: This permission is used **strictly** to upload a backup file (`ahkyaway_mhat_backup.json`) of your app data and to restore (download) that specific file when you request it.
*   **Storage**: The backup file is stored in a private "App Data" folder within your own Google Drive. We cannot see or access any other files in your Google Drive.
*   **Sharing**: We do not transfer, sell, or share your Google user data with any third parties or advertising platforms. Your data remains strictly between your device and your personal Google Drive account.

## 3. Information We Do Not Collect

*   We do not collect your personal phone number, contacts list, or location data for tracking purposes.
*   We do not collect usage analytics that can personally identify you.

## 4. Internet Access

The application requires internet access for the following limited purposes:
*   Performing Cloud Backup and Restore operations (connecting to Google Drive).
*   Checking for application updates via GitHub API.

## 5. Security

We take the security of your data seriously.
*   **At Rest**: Data on your device is encrypted using `FlutterSecureStorage`.
*   **In Transit**: Data transferred to/from Google Drive is protected by Google's secure SSL/TLS protocols.
